## Task:

The system admin team at `xFusionCorp Industries` has streamlined access management by implementing group-based access control. Here's what you need to do:

* Create a group named `nautilus_noc` across all App servers within the Stratos Datacenter.


* Add the user `mohammed` into the `nautilus_noc` group on all App servers. If the user doesn't exist, create it as well.
