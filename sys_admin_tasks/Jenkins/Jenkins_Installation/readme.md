## Task:

The DevOps team of xFusionCorp Industries is planning to setup some CI/CD pipelines. After several meetings they have decided to use Jenkins server. So, we need to setup a Jenkins Server as soon as possible. Please complete the task as per requirements mentioned below:

1. Install jenkins on jenkins server using `yum` utility only, and start its service. You might face timeout issue while starting the Jenkins service, please refer this `link` for help.

2. Jenkin's admin user name should be `theadmin`, password should be `Adm!n321`, full name should be `Ravi` and email should be `ravi@jenkins.stratos.xfusioncorp.com`.

### Note:

* For this task, ssh into the jenkins server using user `root` and password `S3curePass` from `jump host`.

* After installing the Jenkins server, please click on the `Jenkins button` on the top bar to access `Jenkins UI` and follow the on-screen instructions to create an admin user.
