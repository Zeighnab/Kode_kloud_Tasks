## Task:

This morning the Nautilus DevOps team rolled out a new release for one of the applications. Recently one of the customers logged a complaint which seems to be about a bug related to the recent release. Therefore, the team wants to rollback the recent release.


* There is a deployment named `nginx-deployment`; roll it back to the previous revision.
