## Task:

The Nautilus application development team has been working on a project repository `/opt/news.git`. This repo is cloned at `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos` on storage server in Stratos DC. They recently shared the following requirements with DevOps team:

* Create a new branch `xfusion` in `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/news` repo from `master` branch.

* Copy the `/tmp/index.html` file (present on storage server itself) into the repo. 

* Add/ocmmit this file in the new branch and merge back that branch into master branch. 

* Push the changes to the origin for both of the branches.
