## Task:

The Nautilus application development team was working on a git repository `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/news` present on Storage server in Stratos DC. 
This was just a test repository and one of the developers just pushed a couple of changes for testing, but now they want to clean this repository along with the commit history/work tree, so they want to point back the HEAD and the branch itself to a commit with message add data.txt file. Find below more details:

1. In `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/news` git repository, reset the git commit history so that there are only two commits in the commit history i.e `initial` commit and `add data.txt file`.

2. Also make sure to push your changes
