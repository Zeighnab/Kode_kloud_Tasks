## Task:

The Nautilus development team started with new project development. They have created different Git repositories to manage respective project's source code. One of the repositories `/opt/cluster.git` was created recently. 
The team has given us a sample `index.html` file that is currently present on jump host under `/tmp` directory. The repository has been cloned at `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos` on storage server in Stratos DC.

1. Copy sample `index.html` file from jump host to storage server under cloned repository at `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster`, further `add/commit` the file and `push` to the `master` branch.
